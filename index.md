## Supervision Notes 

I have been giving [superivions](http://www.cambridge-strategies.org/features/education-under-supervision/) to engineering undergraduate students at University of Cambridge since 2019. Below are some of the notes I use for my supervisions on dynamics and vibration subjects. 

### Rigid body dynamics 

1. Equations of motion in 3D
2. Inertia matrix 
3. Rotating frame of reference
4. Gyroscopic equation

#### Examples 
1. Inertia matrix for a paper clip
2. 3D dynamics of a complete/partial rubik cube 
3. [Lagrange Top](/Supervision/Dynamics/LagrangeTop.md)


#### Common mistakes and misunderstandings 



### Lagrangian mechanics 

#### Examples 

1. single mass on a spring

2. trolley pendulum system

#### Common mistakes and misunderstandings 

### Linear vibration 

#### Examples
