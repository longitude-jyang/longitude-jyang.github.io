## Supervision Notes 

I have been giving [superivions](http://www.cambridge-strategies.org/features/education-under-supervision/) to engineering undergraduate students at University of Cambridge since 2019. Below are some of the notes I use for my supervisions on dynamics and vibration subjects. 

### Rigid body dynamics 

#### Examples 
1. [Lagrange Top](/Supervision/Dynamics/LagrangeTop.md)

### Lagrangian mechanics 

### Linear vibration
